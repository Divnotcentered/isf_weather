            <div id="adelaide-weather">Loading Adelaide weather...</div>
            <h5>Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, experiences a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Summer, from December to February, brings high temperatures averaging 28-30℃, with frequent heatwaves exceeding 35℃. The city’s location between the Mount Lofty Ranges and Gulf St Vincent creates a “heat island” effect, as surrounding hills trap warm air. Sea breezes from the gulf, known locally as the “southerly buster,” often arrive in the afternoon, providing relief from the summer heat.</h5>

            <div id="winnipeg-weather">Loading Winnipeg weather...</div>
            <h5>Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, experiences a continental climate characterized by extreme seasonal variations. Winters, lasting from November through March, are long and harsh, with average daytime temperatures often below -10℃ and frequent drops below −20℃ during cold snaps. The city’s flat landscape allows Arctic air masses to settle, producing bitter winds and heavy snowfalls, giving Winnipeg its reputation as one of Canada’s coldest major cities. Despite the cold, clear skies are common in winter, creating bright, crisp days.</h5>

            <h5>Kyoto, located in the Kansai region of Japan, experiences a humid subtropical climate, marked by four distinct seasons. Summers, from June to August are hot and humid, with average daytime temperatures around 31℃, often accompanied by oppressive humidity. This season coincides with the East Asian monsoon, bringing frequent rain showers and occasional typhoons in late summer, which influences the city’s lush greenery and river levels. The rainy season, called tsuyu, typically occurs in June and early July, saturating the city and creating a vibrant, verdant atmosphere.</h5>

            <h5>Nakhon Pathom, located just west of Bangkok in central Thailand, experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct hot, rainy and cool seasons. The hot season, from March to May, is characterized by high temperatures often exceeding 35℃ and intense humidity. The city’s low-lying plains can amplify the heat, making afternoons particularly sweltering, though occasional breezes from nearby rivers provide some relief.</h5>
